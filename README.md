# cornell-notes-latex
Created a class file for Cornell Notes template in LaTex.

I have included an example here and the different outputs are provided in pdf form for an idea of how it looks like.

There are two options for the class. One is "dark" - it applies dark theme to the document and other option is "tiles" - it will show the CUES and NOTES titles in the document at their respective columns.

This is my first experience in creating class for LaTex. Feel free to use it any suggestions/modifications are welcome.
