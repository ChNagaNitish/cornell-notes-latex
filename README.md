# cornell-notes-latex
Created a class file for Cornell Notes template in LaTex.

I have included an example here and the different outputs are provided in pdf form for an idea of how it looks like.

I have made the notes tiles color change for every cue created for the remaining block of notes.

There are two options for the class. One is "dark" - it applies dark theme to the document and other option is "tiles" - it will show the CUES and NOTES titles in the document at their respective columns.

There is a problem with "tiles" option and the summary doesn't stick to bottom.

This is my first experience in creating class for LaTex. Feel free to use it any suggestions/modifications are welcome.
